# Gaddit Proposal

## What is Gaddit?

The idea is to create a reddit based website for GA.
Students can create posts, comment on other posts, update comments and/or posts,
and delete their posts and/or comments.

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on website structure

I expect to encounter challenges pertaining to comment and post structures.
Laying out all new posts in an instagram-style structure in the center of page.
I also presume i will run into issues with nested comments.


## Phases of Completion

1. Make sure every page is running and displaying test prompt as expected.
2. populate each page with seeded data.
3. Give user option to create a post, and comment on posts.
4. Store user created post/comment to DB
5. Setup user Auth.
6. explore a way to nest the comments.
7. style the site.
